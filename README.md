my account was JudeForOROINC. it is not accessable now. support says that i must use my phone app that i never has to access F2A to my account. so its stolen now. ill try to continue here. thanks.

and 10y of my work now is loosed. thanks again.  Prediction: skype has same way: 1) sell 2) block all account from FB 3) recomend new accounts 4) close project after 5 y of stagnation and propose move to teams. looks like git will die at 5 y... sad, but 

i will try to restore my projects here from saved local storations if i can.
